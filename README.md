The bokoblin chest is one kind of treasure chest in Zelda: Breath of the wild and Tear of the kingdom. You will find many treasure chests in the dungeons. 
These can contain rupees, items that will increase your power, and dungeon items. 

The purpose of this chest is to mainly store physical game card, however, it can also store jewelry, keys and other small items.

The bokoblin chest is divided into two parts which are top and bottom. The shaft controls the opening of the chest as force is applied. This project includes implemention of 
Solidworks, Rhinocero Modelling, PLC and Auduino. 

## How is it made?
-2D Engineeing drawing and 3D CAD modelling were created for bokoblin chest assembly by using **Solidworks** and **Rhinocero**.
-Includes Arduino nano, vibration sensor, servo motor, LED light strip and PLC electric design.
-Fibricated using rapid prototyping method such as 3D printing

## What can it achieve?
Auto opening and closing, LED light color changes and produced sounds as tapping the box can be achieved. 

The chest can open and close itself if detecting applied force with vibration sensor. As the chest opens, the color of eyes will be changed from purple to orange. It will also 
produce the same sounds game produced in Zelda at the same time.

However, the project is still on the first stage of making models and assembling them.
